Build a fire a thousand miles away to light my long way home
I ride a comet
No matter where I stand I'm alone

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight

Silence is a heavy stone...
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
